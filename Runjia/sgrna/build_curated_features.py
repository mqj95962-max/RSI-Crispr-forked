"""Build feature families on crisprHAL's curated cohort, not the published rows.

The model layer moved to crisprHAL 2's 33,567 curated guides on 13 October; the
feature blocks were built against the published 13,880-row index and had to
follow. This is that build, kept as a module rather than an inline script so
the curated blocks are reproducible from the repo.

Two differences from `build_features`:

  * the index is `data/interim/curated_guide_index.csv` (every curated guide
    located on NC_000913.2, with its flanks), and each family writes
    `features/<family>_curated.csv`;
  * **a block with no populated feature column is a failure, not a null.**
    `b_energy` catches its exceptions per guide and drops the error column, so a
    missing ViennaRNA produced a file containing nothing but 33,567 sgRNAIDs and
    reported success. Fed to an ablation that would have scored Δρ = 0.000 and
    read as a clean negative result. The check below is cheap; the failure it
    catches is silent and would have been reported.

    `g_transcription` needs a b-number to join PRECISE-1K expression, and the
    curated index was built from crisprHAL's CSVs, which carry none -- that is
    what blocked family G on this cohort. The published index got b-numbers
    from Noshay's own annotation, which covers only the rows they published.

    The reference gene table (`genes_NC_000913.2.tsv`, from the Bikard screen)
    gives coordinates and gene *names* but no locus tags, and PRECISE-1K's
    `gene_info.csv` gives locus tags keyed by gene name. So the gene is
    assigned by coordinate on NC_000913.2 and the b-number by name:
    annotation-free where the coordinates matter, and a name lookup only for
    the expression join. 4,130 of the 4,499 reference genes have a PRECISE-1K
    name; guides inside the rest get a gene with no b-number, which the
    expression columns then leave as NaN rather than silently as zero.
