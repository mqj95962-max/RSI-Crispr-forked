"""Family G's own rule, applied on the curated cohort: do the interactions pay?

`g_transcription` was built with a discipline written into its module docstring:
*claim nothing unless an interaction term beats both of its parents.* The reason
is that Guo et al. already reported the marginals as null — target-gene
expression, chromosome position, leading-versus-lagging strand — so the family
exists to test whether a mechanism needing **both** transcription and strand to
line up shows up where neither marginal does.

That discipline was never applied on the curated cohort. Appendix B3 reports the
family at +0.058 there and flags the omission; this closes it. Three arms over
the same base:

    marginals    the 15 columns that are distance, strand, position or
                 expression on their own
    interactions the 4 `eng.txn.ix.*` columns alone
    both         the full family, which is the +0.058 already reported

The rule resolves as: interactions pay only if `both` beats `marginals` by more
than the interaction columns would be expected to add as four arbitrary dense
columns — so the `interactions`-alone arm is the reference for that, not zero.
