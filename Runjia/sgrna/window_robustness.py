"""Would a different set of flank windows have given the same answer?

Family A summarises the flanks in windows of **50, 250, 500 and 1,000 nt**
(`config.FLANK_WINDOWS`). Those four numbers were chosen on the published cohort
after a sweep, so with respect to the curated five folds they are an inherited
constant rather than a choice fitted here. That is the weaker form of the
objection. The stronger form survives it: *a sweep was run, and the reported
figure uses the windows that won it*, so some of family A's gain could be the
sweep's own winner's curse.

**The test that settles it is cheap, and it is a robustness check rather than a
re-selection.** Rebuild family A on a window set chosen to share no value with
the original — **75, 300, 600, 1,200 nt** — and re-measure the gain. The
prediction follows from Finding 4: if the effect is a smooth compositional
gradient rather than a feature of particular window edges, any reasonable set of
four nested windows should recover it, and the two gains should agree to within
fold noise. If instead the original set is worth materially more, the reported
+0.164 is partly a selection artefact and should be discounted.

Declared before running, as the interpretation: agreement within **±0.005 ρ**
(the project's non-inferiority margin) counts as the choice not mattering;
a shortfall beyond that is a winner's curse worth quantifying.
