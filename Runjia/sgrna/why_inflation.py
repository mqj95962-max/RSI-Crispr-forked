"""Why did every family's Δρ roughly triple when the cohort moved?

Four things changed between the published 13,880-row matrix and crisprHAL's
33,567 curated guides, and "noise was removed from the label" is only one of
them:

  1. **the label** -- crisprHAL's read-count-filtered score replaces `cut_score`;
  2. **which rows** -- the cohorts are not nested (8,617 shared, 24,950 only
     crisprHAL, 5,263 only Noshay), and the curated release is genome-wide,
     4,013 genes at 7.5 guides each against a 1,222-gene panel at 11.3;
  3. **how many rows** -- 2.4× more;
  4. **the base representation** -- the curated base is the 6,169 regenerated
     columns and carries none of the published base's 63 hand-named summaries,
     so every family is now measured against a weaker comparison.

Only (1) is noise removal, and (1) is already ruled out: at **fixed rows** --
the 8,617 shared guides, published base -- family A is worth +0.0892 against
`cut_score` and +0.0936 against the curated score (`ablation_label_*.csv`). A
label swap moves it by 0.004 while the cohort move takes it from +0.080 to
+0.164.

This module separates (3) from (2) and (4) the only way available: re-run the
curated ablation on a **random 13,880-row subsample of the curated cohort**. The
subsample holds the label, the row population and the base fixed and changes only
the count, so

    Δρ(13,880 curated rows) ≈ Δρ(33,567)   =>  row count is not the cause
    Δρ(13,880 curated rows) ≈ Δρ(published) =>  row count is the cause

Three seeds of subsample, because one draw of 13,880 from 33,567 is itself a
sample.
