"""Split the 63 hand-named columns into the computable and the rest, and test both.

Finding 2 says the 63 are "non-sequence" columns and that the 427-column reduced
set (364 sequence indicators plus the 63) is non-inferior to all 6,232. An audit
of what they actually contain (`portability_audit.csv`) shows the label is wrong:
**61 of the 63 are the guide re-described** — whole-guide k-mer counts, GC, Tm,
RNA structure, PAM bases, and the 19 `V` columns reconstructible from mono- and
dinucleotide indicators — and only **2** need anything else, both distances that
require gene annotation. A further 15 `V` columns are undecoded and not
reconstructible, so they are unknown rather than computable.

That makes a clean two-way test of a question the report has been circling: when
the 63 help, is it because they carry information the guide does not, or because
they re-spell the guide in a form a depth-limited tree can use?

    computable_46    20 k-mer counts + GC/Tm/structure + 4 PAM + 19
                     reconstructible V -- all functions of the 20-mer
    noncomputable_17 2 annotation distances + 15 undecoded, non-reconstructible V
    all_63           both, which is the published 427 arm

The interpretations, fixed in advance:

  * if `computable_46` carries the gain and `noncomputable_17` does not, the 427
    result is another instance of re-description paying — the same effect as the
    quantum tables, CRISPRoff and ViennaRNA, which all land at +0.011 to +0.019;
  * if `noncomputable_17` carries it, the hand-named columns are a genuine
    source of outside information and annotation-derived features deserve more
    attention than this project has given them.

Run on the published 13,880-row matrix, because that is the only cohort where
these columns exist.
